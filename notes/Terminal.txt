________________________ Find

For searching through files whose path or name contain a query term.

$ find PATH_TO_SEARCH OPTIONS_TO_USE PATTERN_TO_SEARCH_FOR
  
    -name PATTERN : search for file names matching PATTERN
    
    -path PATTERN : any part of the path that matches PATTERN
    
    -type TYPE : Look on for files (f) or directories (d)
  
  Use -name and -path together and both have to be satisfied. (An AND search)
    Use the -or flag to perform an OR search
    Also has not logic with the -not flag
  
  Can sort by time or size with flags -mtime and -size

_______________________ Ag - supposed to be a faster way to search in files

ag example          " search for "example" recursively in current directory
ag example <path>   " search in a particular path
ag -Q example       " search for exact pattern
ag example -l       " list file names only
ag example -i       " case insensitive 
-G <in>             " results must have "in" in name
--ignore-dir <in>   " directories to ignore. ex. dir1/dir2/  OR  "*.rb"
--skip-vcs-ignore   " allow things that are ignored in vcs flavor of choice config files

______________________ sed - search and replace in a file from command line

sed "s/<find>/<replace>/[g][i]" <file>
" uses regular expressions for <find> and <replace>
" need "g" or will only do the first occurance on the line
" "i" will let it be case insensitive

-i    " allow sed to actually edit the file, otherwise just shows on the command line
