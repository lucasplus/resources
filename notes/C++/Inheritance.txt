Notes on class inheritance within C++ 

__________________________________ Public inheritance

Public inheritance models an "is-a" relationship
  - A derived class inherits data members and most methods.
    - Does not inherit constructors, destructors, and assignment operators
  - Can access public and protected 
    - Can access private with public or protected methods
  - When a derived-class object is created: first base-class constructor is called and then derived-class constructor
    - When deleted: derived and then base.

__________________________________ Private and Protected inheritance

Private and Protected inheritance: models a "has-a" relationship
  - public and protected of base-class become private of derived class with private inheritance
  - public and protected of base-class become protected of derived class with protected inheritance

__________________________________ Virtual inheritance

Used to avoid diamond problem. Diamond problem occurs when a class subclasses two classes who both subclass the same class.
