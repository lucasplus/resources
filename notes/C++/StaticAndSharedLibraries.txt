__________________________________ Shared libraries 

File name: Linux .so; Windows .dll; osx .dylib

All code relating to the library is in the file, and it is refrenced by programs
at run-time.

Pro:
Reduces the amount of code that is duplicated in each program that makes use of
the library, keeping the binaries small. 
Shared libraries can be loaded into an application at run-time, which is the 

Con: 
Additional cost for the execution of functions, as well as a run-time loading
coast as all the symbols in the library need to be connected to the things they
use. 

__________________________________ Static libraries 

File name: Linux .a; Windows .lib

All the code relating to the library is in this file, and it is directly linked
into the program at compile time. A program using a static library takes copies
of the code that it uses from the static library and makes it part of the
program.
